# PHONE-NUMBER-TRACKER
A simple python code which uses phonenumbers module of Python to track the country of origin and name of the service provider of the desired phone number. To track the country of origin of the desired phone number, I used geocoder. To track the name of the service provider of the desired phone number, I used carrier.
